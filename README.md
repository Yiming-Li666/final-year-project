# Final-Year-Project
Doctors are overwhelmed by clerical work. A 2016 study estimates that doctors spend between 37% and 49% of their working hours on clerical tasks. All that paperwork contributes to the high level of burnout and depression in the profession, according to a 2019 study. The solution â€“ voice assistant can serve as clinical stenographers that transcribe doctorsâ€™ observations and instructions and insert them into a patientâ€™s electronic health record (EHR).

#### Task-specific project aims include [Research: 60%; Implementation: 40%]:
*  Develop a voice recognition by utilising deep learning to capture the doctorsâ€™ voice.  
* Build natural language task model that incorporate word embeddings, entity recognition and text classification for clinical text records.  
* Design a basic GUI application for demonstration purpose.
